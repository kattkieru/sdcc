Small Device C Compiler 3.6.1 (Revision 9917)

This is a direct clone from the main repo:
https://sourceforge.net/p/sdcc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/sdcc/

I'm not doing anything special; I just want to make sure that I have a locked version for the Toolchain.
Please use cmake to build from this folder for the Toolchain binaries and libs to end up in the right
spot.
